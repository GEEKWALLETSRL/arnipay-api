# API Documentation

[Versión en Español](es/README.md)

Welcome to the API documentation for our payment processing system.

## Available Documentation

- [Payment Links API Documentation](payment-links.md) - Complete documentation of the Payment Links API endpoints, authentication, request/response formats, and best practices.
- [Payment Links Code Examples](payment-links-examples.md) - Practical code examples in multiple programming languages for integrating with the Payment Links API.

## Authentication

All API endpoints require signature-based authentication using your Commerce credentials:

- `X-Client-ID`: Your Commerce client ID (UUID format)
- `X-Timestamp`: Current Unix timestamp as an integer (seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC)
- `X-Signature`: HMAC-SHA256 signature generated using your private key

Requests expire 15 minutes from the `X-Timestamp`.

We use a single canonical string format for both API requests and webhooks:

**Canonical components:**
1. Uppercased HTTP method (e.g. `GET`, `POST`)
2. Request URI (path + query only; no scheme/host)
3. Unix timestamp (same as `X-Timestamp`)
4. Stable identifier (same as `X-Client-ID`)
5. Base64-encoded SHA-256 of the raw body: `base64(sha256(raw_body))`. For requests without a body use `base64(sha256(""))`

Join the components with newlines (`"\n"`) and compute the signature:
```
canonical = join("\n", [METHOD, URI, TIMESTAMP, CLIENT_ID, base64(sha256(RAW_BODY))])
signature = HMAC-SHA256(canonical, PRIVATE_KEY)
```

Send JSON bodies without extra escaping using `json_encode` with `JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE` so the raw body matches what the server verifies.

You can find your client ID and private key in your Commerce settings page, or regenerate them if needed.

## API Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is:

```
https://arnipay.com.py/api/v1/
```

## Webhooks

Our payment system can send real-time notifications to your server using webhooks when payment events occur. Set up your webhook URL and configuration in the Commerce settings page to receive these notifications.

Webhook requests use the same canonical string and headers as API requests and include an additional `X-Webhook-ID` header.

Key webhook features:
- Real-time payment notifications (completed, failed, pending)
- Secure delivery with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification using the canonical string
- Configurable retry mechanism
- Detailed event payloads

For detailed information about webhooks and implementation examples, see:
- [Webhook Configuration Documentation](payment-links.md#webhook-notifications)
- [Webhook Implementation Examples](payment-links-examples.md#webhook-examples)

## Rate Limiting

Our API implements rate limiting to protect the service. The current limits are:

- 60 requests per minute per client
- 1000 requests per day per client

If you exceed these limits, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

## Support
